# Assessment - Product Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RomainEndelin/product_manager_assessment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RomainEndelin/product_manager_assessment) | [Product Manager](https://product-manager-assessment.herokuapp.com)

This project is a technical assessment for SaleStock's recruitment process. I have chosen to implement a REST API for a product manager.

It includes the following features:

* CRUD operations on products and categories;
* Hierarchical tree data of categories;
* Filtering products by color, size or price range.

## Usage

`Product Manager` has been deployed on `Heroku`, access it [here](https://product-manager-assessment.herokuapp.com).

You can interact with `Product manager` using `curl`, a [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo), a [Firefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/), or an [IE plugin](https://goo.gl/FkCd13).
